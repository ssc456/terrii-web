a care provider platform built to improve communication between care staff and families of residents in a dementia care setting. This is the MVP version. The UI should follow a mobile-first structure, use a soft, calming aesthetic (pastel greens, light blue backgrounds, rounded corners, and clean sans-serif typography like Nunito or Inter), and be simple, accessible, and intuitive.

üé® Global Design System:
Use a soft green (#DFF2E1) and pastel blue (#E6F1FA) palette with white backgrounds and charcoal/grey text.

Font: Nunito or Inter. Use 20pt+ for headings, 14‚Äì16pt for body, 12pt for small labels.

Create consistent card components, buttons (primary, secondary, text-only), message bubbles, tags, and graph tiles using Auto Layout.

Navigation: use a bottom nav bar with 5 sections: Residents, Messages, Shared Moments, Angela Sync, Insights.

üì± Core Screens (and their components):
1. Login / Onboarding
Login page with email/password, ‚ÄúForgot password?‚Äù link
