/**
 * FAMILY MEMBER USER LINKING SYSTEM - DOCUMENTATION
 *

 */

/**
 * CURRENT ARCHITECTURE (Already Perfect!)
 * 
 * TerriiResidentFamily Schema includes:
 * ✅ userID?: string | null          // Links to User account  
 * ✅ user?: User | null              // GraphQL relationship
 * ✅ isRegistered?: boolean | null   // Registration status
 * ✅ name, relationship, phone, email // Contact info
 * 
 * TerriiUserRole enum includes:
 * ✅ FAMILY                          // Role for family member users
 * 
 * TerriiUserProfile:
 * ✅ Links User accounts to care homes with roles
 */

/**
 * THE FAMILY MEMBER LIFECYCLE:
 * 
 * 1. INITIAL CREATION (Contact Only)
 *    - Family member created as TerriiResidentFamily record
 *    - userID = null, isRegistered = false
 *    - Only has name, relationship, phone, email
 * 
 * 2. INVITATION SENT  
 *    - Care staff invites family member via email
 *    - Family member receives link to register
 * 
 * 3. USER REGISTRATION
 *    - Family member creates User account
 *    - TerriiUserProfile created with FAMILY role
 *    - TerriiResidentFamily updated with userID, isRegistered = true
 * 
 * 4. MESSAGING ENABLED
 *    - Now can receive real messages (not just email notifications)
 *    - Messages sent to userID, not just email
 */

/**
 * IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
 * 
 * Step 1: Create family member as contact
 * ----------------------------------------
 * await addResidentFamilyMember(residentId, {
 *   name: "John Smith",
 *   relationship: "Son", 
 *   phone: "555-123-4567",
 *   email: "john.smith@email.com"
 *   // userID: null (implicit)
 *   // isRegistered: false (implicit)
 * });
 * 
 * Step 2: Invite to register
 * -------------------------
 * await inviteFamilyMemberToRegister(familyMemberId, residentName);
 * 
 * Step 3: Link User account when they register
 * -------------------------------------------
 * await linkUserToFamilyMember(newUserId, "john.smith@email.com");
 * 
 * Step 4: Message only registered family members
 * ---------------------------------------------
 * const registeredFamily = await getRegisteredFamilyMembers(residentId);
 */

/**
 * YOUR EXISTING terriiApi.ts FUNCTIONS ALREADY SUPPORT THIS:
 * 
 * ✅ addResidentFamilyMember() - Creates family member contacts
 * ✅ inviteFamilyMemberToRegister() - Sends invitations
 * ✅ linkUserToFamilyMember() - Links User accounts
 * ✅ getRegisteredFamilyMembers() - Gets User-linked family members
 * ✅ createThreadWithMessage() - Creates message threads
 */

/**
 * WHAT YOU NEED TO IMPLEMENT:
 * 
 * 1. UPDATE UI COMPONENTS:
 *    - Show family member registration status in resident profiles
 *    - Show "Invite to Register" buttons for unregistered family
 *    - Show "Can Receive Messages" status indicators
 * 
 * 2. UPDATE MESSAGING COMPONENTS:
 *    - Filter family member lists to only show registered users
 *    - Show warning if trying to message unregistered family
 *    - Use User IDs for messaging, not emails
 * 
 * 3. REGISTRATION FLOW:
 *    - Family member registration page
 *    - Email invitation system
 *    - Link new User accounts to existing family member records

/**
 * KEY INSIGHT:
 * 
 * Your database schema is already perfect! The issue isn't the architecture,
 * it's that you need to:
 * 
 * 1. Build UI flows for family member registration
 * 2. Restrict messaging to registered family members only
 * 3. Show registration status in your UI
 * 
 * The foundation is solid - now you need the user experience layer.
