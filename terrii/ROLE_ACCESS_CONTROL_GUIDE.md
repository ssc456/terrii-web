```typescript
enum EnumUserTypes {
  ACECURA_ADMIN = "ACECURA_ADMIN",  // Super admin (system-wide)
  APP_USER = "APP_USER",            // Regular application user

features: ['system_stats', 'role_testing', 'global_user_management']
```

#### **ADMIN**
```typescript
// Care home focused
routes: ['/', '/residents', '/messages', '/moments', '/community', '/settings']
features: ['care_home_management', 'staff_invites', 'family_management', 'reporting']
restrictions: ['no_system_access', 'single_care_home_only']
```

#### **MANAGER**
```typescript
// Operational management

## **Implementation Checklist**

### **‚úÖ Completed:**
- [x] Role-based route protection
- [x] SuperAdmin dashboard with role testing
- [x] User management system
- [x] "Login As" functionality for testing
- [x] Role distribution statistics
- [x] Backend API integration for community/moments

### **üîÑ In Progress:**
- [ ] Family member portal UI
- [ ] Role-specific component visibility
- [ ] Enhanced permission checks in components

### **üìã Needed:**
- [ ] Care staff resident assignment system
- [ ] Family member invitation workflow
- [ ] Role-based data filtering
- [ ] Audit logging for role changes
- [ ] Family dashboard implementation

## **Testing Your Roles**

### **Using SuperAdmin Dashboard:**

1. **Access Testing Environment:**
   ```
   Login as ACECURA_ADMIN ‚Üí Navigate to /admin ‚Üí Role Testing tab
   ```

2. **Test Different Roles:**
   - Select a care home
   - Click role-specific buttons (Admin View, Manager View, etc.)
   - System automatically logs you in as that role
   - Test functionality and UI differences

3. **Return to SuperAdmin:**
   - Clear localStorage testing flags
   - Navigate back to /admin

### **Manual Testing:**
```typescript
// Test role checking in browser console
const { terriiProfile } = useAuth();
console.log('Current role:', terriiProfile?.role);
console.log('Is staff:', ['ADMIN', 'CARE_STAFF', 'MANAGER'].includes(terriiProfile?.role));
console.log('Is family:', terriiProfile?.role === 'FAMILY');
```

## **Security Considerations**

### **Backend Validation:**
- ‚úÖ All role checks must be validated server-side
- ‚úÖ GraphQL auth rules enforce data access
- ‚úÖ Care home isolation prevents cross-access
- ‚úÖ Family members limited to linked residents only

### **Frontend Protection:**
- ‚úÖ Route-level protection with ProtectedRoute component
- ‚úÖ Component-level permission checks
- ‚úÖ API calls validate user permissions
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Remember:** Frontend security is for UX only, not security

## **Next Steps for Implementation**

1. **Enhance Component Permissions:**
   ```typescript
   // Add role checks to components
   const { terriiProfile } = useAuth();
   const canManageStaff = ['ADMIN', 'MANAGER'].includes(terriiProfile?.role);
   ```

2. **Implement Family Portal:**
   - Create `/family/*` routes
   - Build family-specific components
   - Add resident linking system

3. **Add Resident Assignment:**
   - CARE_STAFF assigned to specific residents
   - Filter data based on assignments
   - Manager oversight of assignments

4. **Audit & Logging:**
   - Track role changes
   - Log permission escalations
   - Monitor cross-care-home access attempts

This comprehensive role system provides secure, scalable access control with proper testing capabilities for your TERRii platform.
